## Motivation

Inspired by [Rambox](https://github.com/ramboxapp/community-edition) and [Franz](https://github.com/meetfranz/franz), I created **ElectronIM** out of the necessity for an all-in-one instant messaging app that did not require registration, provided spell checking for free, and ensured maximum user privacy by never tracking user activity or sending telemetry data.
With built-in screen sharing and strict privacy principles, ElectronIM offers a secure and flexible communication hub.
